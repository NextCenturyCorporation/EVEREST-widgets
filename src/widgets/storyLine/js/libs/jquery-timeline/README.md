# jQuery Timeline #

## History ##
- In 2006, as part of the **SIMILE** project originally sponsored by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, MIT created an open-source JavaScript widget called **Timeline**.

- In 2009, **Timeline** fell into disrepair and was no longer actively maintainned.
- On July 8, 2013, a mysterious GitHub-er named **kusog** resurrected **Timeline** and completely overhauled it to fix lots of longstanding bugs, remove code not being used, and streamline the code to use jQuery which reduces the existing code in size.

- On November 29, 2013, **kusog** made his very last commit and left the project.
- On December 12, 2013, a less mysterious GitHub-er named **PaulGilbert** opened up an issue which beautifully outlines all of the outstanding bugs which **kusog** never fixed.

- On December 19, 2013, Next Century fixed the outstanding bugs as part of its effort to create a **StoryLine** widget.
